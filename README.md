# 🏥 Kidney Disease Prediction

## 📜 Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting chronic kidney disease (CKD) using machine learning techniques. It involves data wrangling, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature encoding and selection, and building and deploying a predictive model. The goal is to provide insights and predictions to help in early detection and management of kidney disease.
